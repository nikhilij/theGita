# Translation Service Improvement TODO

## Current Issues:
- Translations are not displaying properly in the webapp
- Translation quality needs improvement - hard to read and understand
- Need a more communicable and understandable translation approach

## Proposed Solution:
- Implement vector-based translation similar to RAG servers for agentic operations
- Enhance translation quality with context-aware approaches
- Fix display issues in the webapp frontend
- Consider pre-translating key content for better quality control

## Implementation Steps:
1. Upgrade translation model to a more context-aware solution
2. Implement vector embeddings for better semantic understanding
3. Create a caching mechanism for frequently translated content
4. Add context hints to improve translation quality
5. Fix UI display issues related to translated content

## Resources:
- Investigate models like NLLB-200, GPT-4 with translation plugins
- Research embedding techniques for better context preservation
- Consider human review pipeline for key translations
